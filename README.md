# Fract-ol (threaded)

I was havign loads of fun making the original fract-ol program, but kept running into the issue that, IT WAS REALLY SLOW.
And while there may be some smart way to improve performance via ~Math~ I am unfortunatly not smart enough to figure that out, but what I do know how to do is threading, although the original subject does not allow for this, I just wanted to do it to see more of the beautiful fractols i was producing, so I did it.

This branch is just for me to play around with and will not be maintained.
